MeanStdData        =  a dataframe of just the mean and standard deviations each measurements 
selectedColumns    =  the neames of the columns in CombinedDF that were kept to make MeanStdData
SetNames           =  list of all features (as per original dataset),  
subdataSetNames    =  list of featues with "mean(" or "std(" in the name (the parenthesis to rule out "meanfreq" variables)
SubjectTest        =  the subject who performed the activity for test subject sample, range 1-30
SubjectTrain       =  the subject who performed the activity for train subject sample, range 1-30
TestLabels         =  test labels
TestSet            =  test set
TidyData           =  the final independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
TotalLabels        =  combination of test and training labets
